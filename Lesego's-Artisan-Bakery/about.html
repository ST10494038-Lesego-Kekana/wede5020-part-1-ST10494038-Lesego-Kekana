      Lesego's Artisan Bakery started in 2022. It was created by Lesego Sonia Kekana, 
      who was only 19 years old at the time,
       which is located at 23 Magwa Cres St, Halfway House, 1682. 
      She always loved baking and dreamed of owning her own bakery one day. 
      At first, Lesego baked cookies and muffins at home and sold them at school.
       But selling at school was not allowed, 
      so she had to stop. Still, she didn't give up. 
      She started selling her baked goods on weekends at taxi ranks and on the streets.
       Lesego saved the money she made and used it to open her first bakery. 
      Sadly, the store burned down, and she lost everything. But the people
       in her community helped her with donations, and she was able to open a new store.
        This time, the bakery was a success. 
      Today, Lesego's Artisan Bakery is known for tasty baked goods and for the 
      strong young woman who never gave up on her dream.
      Our business goal is to supply customers with the best value
       for their hard-earned money by offering the finest and tastiest baked goods on the market.
        Our heart and soul lie in providing you with delicious
       hand-made goods that will make you feel like the best version of yourself.
